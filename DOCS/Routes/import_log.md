# `import_log`

## Overview
The `import_log` functionality allows users to upload log files to the server for processing and storage.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Log File Upload**:
   - The client uploads a log file via the HTTP POST endpoint `/import_log`.

2. **Batch Creation**:
   - The route handler receives the log file and sends it to the `batch_maker`.
   - The `batch_maker` reads the log file and creates batches of up to **1,000 log entries**.

3. **Message Queue**:
   - Created batches are pushed onto a **message queue** for asynchronous processing.

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - The application dequeues batches from the message queue.
   - The `LogCollector` processes these batches, parsing log entries into structured `LogEntry` objects.

5. **Storage Module**:
   - The `LogCollector` sends the parsed `LogEntry` objects to the storage module for insertion into a **SQLite3** database.

6. **Completion**:
   - After successful storage, the system acknowledges the completion of log processing.
   - If errors occur, the system handles them appropriately.

## Summary
The `import_log` process efficiently manages log file uploads, batch processing, and storage, providing a scalable solution for log handling.
